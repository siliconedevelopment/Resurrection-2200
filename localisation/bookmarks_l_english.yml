 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Recolonisation of the Wasteland"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Nuclear War of 2056, the Second Dark Ages commenced, uprisings, independence movements, anarchy, all have brought the world into disrepair and chaos, back to the times of the 8th century, back into Feudalism and Slavery. Democracy, Liberty and Fraternity have all been cast to small areas of Britain and Europe. It'll take a radical change in the somewhat established nations to go back to what it was, the Good Times."

 BLITZKRIEG_NAME:0 "Blitzkrieg"
 BLITZKRIEG_DESC:0 "In the last few years the world has seen some new wars break out in Europe and Asia. Spain is now governed by nationalists and Japan has fought both the Soviet Union and China for territory, the latter being a more successful battle for Japan. The new non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany may be bad news for the rest of Europe."
